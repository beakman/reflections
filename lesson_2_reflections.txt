What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden directory is created. There Git will store the history of the changes
of the files inside the repository. This command is needed to create that folder
and the bunch of metadata needed for tracking those files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

It's an intermediate state of the files. Having an staging area make easier to
reflects the changes and the files that will be commited from the working
directory to the repository.
