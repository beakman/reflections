When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to work with people in other locations. Or if you want a safe place to save your progress.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To prevent that local changes get lost if another user works in the remote repository, it's useful to pull the changes manually, checking
first what are you going to do.
